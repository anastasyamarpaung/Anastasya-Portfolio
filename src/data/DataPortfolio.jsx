        description: 'This project is a 3D horror adventure game developed using the Swift programming language and SpriteKit framework. The gameplay is designed with a tilting mechanism, where players move the main character by tilting the device. The main challenge in this game is to avoid all objects or obstacles that appear along the path. If the player touches any of the objects they pass, the game will immediately end. Conversely, the player is considered to have won if they successfully avoid all obstacles and reach the finish line safely. This mechanism is designed to test the players precision, focus, and reflexes in facing the tense challenges characteristic of the horror genre.'

        skill:'Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask, Detectron2',
        description: 'This study successfully applied the Faster R-CNN algorithm to automatically detect cabbage plants from aerial images. The model was developed through fine-tuning several pretrained backbones and tested on two versions of the dataset without augmentation or preprocessing. The best results were obtained from the ResNet-50 C4 backbone with dataset version 1, achieving an mAP of 65.64%. The evaluation revealed potential overfitting in some backbones, as well as varying effects of augmentation and preprocessing, depending on the type of backbone. Additionally, a web interface has been successfully developed that allows users to upload images and obtain automatic predictions of the number of plants.'

In addition, this project also aims to build strategic partnerships with fertilizer distributors to create a more efficient and affordable distribution network, with distribution subsidies from the government to reduce fertilizer prices in remote areas. Furthermore, the project includes an educational program on the importance of using appropriate fertilizers based on recommendations from AI technology. As part of the supporting infrastructure, agricultural supply distribution centers will be established in strategic locations to make it easier and more convenient for farmers to access fertilizers and other agricultural needs.'
